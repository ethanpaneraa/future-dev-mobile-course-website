# Week 1: Foundation & Supabase Setup

Welcome to our first week! We'll be setting up our development environment and learning the core technologies that will power our TaskGram app.

## Workshop Topics

### 1. Introduction to Mobile Development

- Understanding mobile app architectures
- Native vs. Cross-platform development
- Why React Native & Expo?
- Overview of our tech stack

### 2. Development Environment Setup

- Installing necessary tools:
  - Node.js and npm
  - Expo CLI
  - VS Code & helpful extensions
  - Git & GitHub
- Setting up your first React Native project

### 3. TypeScript Fundamentals

- Why TypeScript?
- Basic types and interfaces
- Type inference and annotations
- TypeScript with React Native

### 4. React Native Basics

- Components and JSX
- React Native core components
- Styling with NativeWind
- Basic navigation setup

### 5. Supabase Introduction

- What is Supabase?
- Setting up a Supabase project
- Basic authentication flow
- Database setup basics

## Hands-on Project Work

Today we'll start building TaskGram by:

1. Creating a new Expo project
2. Setting up TypeScript configuration
3. Implementing basic navigation
4. Creating initial screens:
   - Login/Signup
   - Home
   - Profile

## Code Examples

### Creating a New Expo Project

```bash
npx create-expo-app TaskGram --template expo-template-typescript
cd TaskGram
npx expo start
```

### Basic Screen Component

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { View, Text } from "react-native";

interface HomeScreenProps {
  // We'll add props as needed
}

export default function HomeScreen({}: HomeScreenProps) {
  return (
    <View className="flex-1 items-center justify-center bg-white">
      <Text className="text-xl font-bold">Welcome to TaskGram</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Supabase Setup

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const supabaseUrl = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL";
const supabaseAnonKey = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY";

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

## Assignment

Your first assignment will be to:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Create a new Expo project
3. Implement a basic navigation structure
4. Create placeholder screens
5. Connect to Supabase
